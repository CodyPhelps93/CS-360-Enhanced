# CS-360-Enhanced
This is an enhancement to my first android application created in CS-360. <br/>
It features a new menu view and sepeartes the clutter when all elements were on 1 view. It has <code>SharedPreferences</code> to allow multi-user preferences and to filter queries from the DB for more secure data.
